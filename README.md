# Realtime GTFS Transit Data for Montreal

This app plots realtime [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime) data from the [Montreal STM](https://developpeurs.stm.info) on a map, along with additional layers of data coming from [Montreal Open Data](https://donnees.montreal.ca).

The Express server fetches and caches data from the STM API every 11 seconds, then pushes the data to the client over a GraphQL subscription using WebSockets.

The frontend is built with React on Next.js and runs Uber's performant WebGL based mapping library, [Deck.gl](https://deck.gl).

# Example app with [chakra-ui](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui)

This example features how to use [chakra-ui](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui) as the component library within a Next.js app.

We are connecting the Next.js `_app.js` with `chakra-ui`'s Theme and ColorMode containers so the pages can have app-wide dark/light mode. We are also creating some components which shows the usage of `chakra-ui`'s style props.

# How To Install PostgreSQL on Ubuntu 20.04 [Quickstart]

## Introduction

PostgreSQL, or Postgres, is a relational database management system that provides an implementation of the SQL querying language. It‚Äôs standards-compliant and has many advanced features like reliable transactions and concurrency without read locks.

This guide demonstrates how to quickly get Postgres up and running on an Ubuntu 20.04 server, from installing PostgreSQL to setting up a new user and database. If you‚Äôd prefer a more in-depth tutorial on installing and managing a PostgreSQL database, see How To Install and Use PostgreSQL on Ubuntu 20.04.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need one Ubuntu 20.04 server that has been configured by following our Initial Server Setup for Ubuntu 20.04 guide. After completing this prerequisite tutorial, your server should have a non-root user with sudo permissions and a basic firewall.

You can also use an interactive terminal that is embedded on this page to experiment with installing and configuring PostgreSQL in this tutorial. Click the following Launch an Interactive Terminal! button to get started.

## Launch an Interactive Terminal!

## Step 1 ‚Äî Installing PostgreSQL

To install PostgreSQL, first refresh your server‚Äôs local package index:

```java
sudo apt update
```

Then, install the Postgres package along with a -contrib package that adds some additional utilities and functionality:

```java
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

Ensure that the service is started:

```java
sudo systemctl start postgresql.service
```

## Step 2 ‚Äî Using PostgreSQL Roles and Databases

By default, Postgres uses a concept called ‚Äúroles‚Äù to handle authentication and authorization. These are, in some ways, similar to regular Unix-style users and groups.

Upon installation, Postgres is set up to use ident authentication, meaning that it associates Postgres roles with a matching Unix/Linux system account. If a role exists within Postgres, a Unix/Linux username with the same name is able to sign in as that role.

The installation procedure created a user account called postgres that is associated with the default Postgres role. There are a few ways to utilize this account to access Postgres. One way is to switch over to the postgres account on your server by running the following command:

```java
sudo -i -u postgres
```

Then you can access the Postgres prompt by running:

```java
psql
```

This will log you into the PostgreSQL prompt, and from here you are free to interact with the database management system right away.

To exit out of the PostgreSQL prompt, run the following:

```java
\q
```

This will bring you back to the postgres Linux command prompt. To return to your regular system user, run the exit command:

```java
exit
```

Another way to connect to the Postgres prompt is to run the psql command as the postgres account directly with sudo:

```java
sudo -u postgres psql
```

This will log you directly into Postgres without the intermediary bash shell in between.

Again, you can exit the interactive Postgres session by running the following:

```java
\q
```

## Step 3 ‚Äî Creating a New Role

If you are logged in as the postgres account, you can create a new role by running the following command:

```java
createuser --interactive
```

If, instead, you prefer to use sudo for each command without switching from your normal account, run:

```java
sudo -u postgres createuser --interactive
```

Either way, the script will prompt you with some choices and, based on your responses, execute the correct Postgres commands to create a user to your specifications.

Output

```java
Enter name of role to add: sammy
Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n) y
```

## Step 4 ‚Äî Creating a New Database

Another assumption that the Postgres authentication system makes by default is that for any role used to log in, that role will have a database with the same name which it can access.

This means that if the user you created in the last section is called sammy, that role will attempt to connect to a database which is also called ‚Äúsammy‚Äù by default. You can create the appropriate database with the createdb command.

If you are logged in as the postgres account, you would type something like the following:

```java
createdb sammy
```

If, instead, you prefer to use sudo for each command without switching from your normal account, you would run:

```java
sudo -u postgres createdb sammy
```

## Step 5 ‚Äî Opening a Postgres Prompt with the New Role

To log in with ident based authentication, you‚Äôll need a Linux user with the same name as your Postgres role and database.

If you don‚Äôt have a matching Linux user available, you can create one with the adduser command. You will have to do this from your non-root account with sudo privileges (meaning, not logged in as the postgres user):

```java
sudo adduser sammy
```

Once this new account is available, you can either switch over and connect to the database by running the following:

```java
sudo -i -u sammy
psql
```

Or, you can do this inline:

```java
sudo -u sammy psql
```

This command will log you in automatically, assuming that all of the components have been properly configured.

If you want your user to connect to a different database, you can do so by specifying the database like the following:

```java
psql -d postgres
```

Once logged in, you can get check your current connection information by running:

```java
sammy=# \conninfo
```

```java
Output
You are connected to database "sammy" as user "sammy" via socket in "/var/run/postgresql" at port "5432".
```
